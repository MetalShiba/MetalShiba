### Hi there üëã

**MetalShiba is is the first-of-its-kind digital comic experience designed for the blockchain community. A piece of art.**

**Comic**

*‚ÄúMetal Shiba is faced with a final and mysterious threat. The "Makers" are invading Dogeville, reaping its citizens faster and faster. In a race against time, he will have to commit all his strength to understand what is happening and how to stop the catastrophe.‚Äù*

Metal Shiba is the ultimate superhero inspired by the Shiba meme. The idea is to then create a paper version and promote it at the most famous comic book international fairs (such as Lucca Comics). This will benefit not only the comic itself but also the token and community built around it. Comics are created by professional artists and We are therefore going to sell real "Works of Art‚Äù of artistic value.

The story and characters will inspire an NFT collection and P2E game. Metal Shiba Inu chapters will be added weekly to the read section of our website accessible by holding our tokens.

The 1st press will be available to buy in limited edition as an OG NFT and will be shipped physically to the customer once completed.

**Metal Shiba NFT Marketplace**

A "Marketplace" platform where initially Metal Shiba NFTs will be sold in an exclusive collection for holders. After that the platform will be opened to emergent artists, and projects related to the comics ecosystem, giving the marketplace a real identity and a targeted audience.
